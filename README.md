# R Markdown and Leaflet Assignment

This project is a submission for the Coursera Data Science assignment "R Markdown and Leaflet".

## Overview

The goal of this assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. The webpage hosts an interactive map of hypothetical Air Quality Monitoring Stations and displays the date the document was created.

## Files

*   **`index.Rmd`**: The R Markdown source file containing the code to generate the map.
*   **`index.html`** (to be generated): The compiled HTML webpage.

## How to View

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the interactive map.
3.  Alternatively, if you have RStudio installed, you can open `index.Rmd` and Knit it to generate the HTML yourself.
